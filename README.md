Companion code for the paper "An End-To-End Non-Intrusive Model for Subjective and Objective Real-World Speech Assessment Using a Multi-Task Framework", ICASSP 2021.

The dataset (e.g., human MOS scores for COSINE and VOiCES) is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wIgOqnKA1U-wZQrU8eb67yQyRVOK3SnZ).

Note:
The current model takes in fixed 4s audio/speech as input, padding/truncation is needed.
Two pretrained models (on COSINE and VOiCES datasets, respectively) are provided. For different datasets, we recommend to retrain the model.
